## Autowiring : Inject reference automatically. (premetive are not allowed).

Exmaple: 
//we can not use autowiring here because street and city are of premetive type
<bean name="address" class="com.sachin.autowiring.Address" p:street="Meerpur" p:city="BSR" />

//we can use autowiring here 
<bean name="employee" class="com.sachin.autowiring.Employee" autowire ="byName" />

1. byName: To use byName class Employee should has Address reference variable with name as 'address' 
            because in .xml file we created bean for Address class with name = 'address'. So it will 
            search bean by the variable name same as the bean name.
2. byType: Now reference type will be consider to get the bean automatically. But it may possible that
           there are more than one bean with the same type, in this case we will get an exception.
   Ex: 
   <bean name="employee" class="com.sachin.autowiring.Employee" autowire ="byName" />           

3. constructor: It will use constructor to get the object.
   Ex:
   <bean name="employee3" class="com.sachin.autowiring.Employee" autowire ="constructor" />




## Autowiring using Annotation:
@Autowired  //it works like byType when use on variable

We can use @Autowired on variable, or on setter method, or on constructor.

If we have two bean (with different name but of same type) then we can use @Qualifier("name_of_bean") 
notation.

Ex:
   @Autowired
   @Qualifier("address1")
   private Address address;

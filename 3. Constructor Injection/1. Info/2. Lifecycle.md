## Lifecycle: 
There are two methods in Spring Bean lifecycle. Name of these methods can be anything but we need to 
tell spring about it using .xml file.

1. init method : To initialize 
2. destroy method : To close some connection 


Execution order:
    1. Constructor
    2. Setter method
    3. Init method
    4. Normal execution
    5. Destroy method


Methods signature:
public void init(){     //name can be anything but remaining thing will be same

}

public void destroy(){

}


How to Tell spring:
<bean name="s1" class="com.sachin.lifecycle.Samosa" p:price="45" init-method="init" destroy-method="destroy" />

by default desroy method will not be called, so we need to use AbstractApplicationContext interface method to call it:

context.registerShutdownHook();



## Implementing lifecycle methods uisng Interface:
implements below interface:
1. InitializingBean -> for init method override:
    public void afterPropertiesSet() throws Exception method 
2. DisposableBean -> for destory method override:
    public void destroy() throws Exception

## Implementing lifecycle methods uisng annotations:    
1. @PostConstruct
2. @PreDestroy

Bydefault annotations are dissabled, so to use @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy, we need to enable the annotations inside beans tag.
For only @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy: 
<bean class="org.springframework.context.annotation.CommonAnnotationBeanPostProcessor"></bean>

For all annotations: 
<context:annotation-config />


If we are using java 9+ version then follow below step as well.

For annotations in Java 9+:
Note that both the @PostConstruct and @PreDestroy annotations are part of Java EE. Since Java EE was deprecated in Java 9, and removed in Java 11, we have to add an additional dependency to use these annotations:

<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.annotation</groupId>
    <artifactId>javax.annotation-api</artifactId>
    <version>1.3.2</version>
</dependency>

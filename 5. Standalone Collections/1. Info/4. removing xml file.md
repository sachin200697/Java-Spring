To remove the .xml file for the configuration, we need to create a java class that will take 
care of configuration.


@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages="com.sachin.javaconfig")
class JavaConfig{

}


now to use the ApplicationContext, we need to do following in main class:
ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(JavaConfig.class);

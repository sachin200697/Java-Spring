To handle the complex form, we can create another class object inside an entity. For example:

Student class can have an Address object.

class Address {
    String city, state;
}

class Student{
    String name;
    String age;
    Address add;
}


Now in the html form we need to give the name like below for city and state:

<input type="text" name="add.city">
<input type="text" name="add.state">
